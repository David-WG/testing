		"body": "**Welcome to LOOT.io Closed Beta!**\n\nWe are so excited to be able to share our game with you! We wanted to quickly showcase what to expect during the Closed Beta.\n\n+ **Explore** a mysterious world.\n+ Defeat monstrous enemies.\n+ Collect **rare loot**!\n+ Visit an **Outpost** to send your loot back to town.\n+ Die and repeat!\n\nHead back to town and equip weapons, augments, and gear to **completely** customize your playstyle. If you're happy with what you have equipped, then put newfound loot in the **Smelting Furnaces** to earn coins or list your best items on the **Marketplace** to sell to other players.\n\nThe game you are about to play is **not the final version**, but a solid representation of what the game will be, and what we are aiming for. We are still actively developing to craft the best experience for players, and we will act swiftly to resolve issues and improve the game based on feedback.\n\nPlease **share your thoughts** on [Discord](https://discord.gg/jffWpwAvfs). We would love to hear your thoughts, opinions, concerns, and compliments!\n\nThanks again for signing up and happy looting!\n\nTips\n\n+ For the best experience, please use a mouse for shooting and aiming. It's much easier than a touchpad.\n+ In the Adventure World, use the **Compass** (top right corner) to quickly find locations in-game.\n+ In the Hub World (town), use the **Main Menu** (top right corner) to quickly access different vendors and stations to save yourself the walk.\n+ The tutorial in the Hub World only directs you to 3 locations, but feel free to explore everything!\n+ Want to change your character's look? Open the **Player Profile** from the main menu and select 'Change Skin'. Many different looks to choose from!\n+ Though the game will work on all browsers, we recommend Chrome if you have a choice.\n\nKnown Issues\n\n+ When a run is ended voluntarily, the death animation will play. This is strictly visual and does not impact any loot returning. \n+ Occasionally the game will display a white screen, due to a WebGL or 'Out of memory' crash. You can refresh the page to bypass this issue.\n+ There may be delays between input and in game actions, most notable during times of high player/enemy count during combat.\n+ Compass' 'POI' option will only point to one POI location in biomes that have 2.\n+ Weapon PFX (such as a charge up or a beam) can be offset from the weapon when moving around.\n+ Slight delay when posting or purchasing an item from the Marketplace, along with collecting coins from the Furnace.\n+ Rarity filter on the Augment screen can be changed during the tutorial causing a soft block.  If this happens, just clear the filter to be able to perform the appropriate action.\n",

		"body": "**Patch 0.8.1 - Closed Beta**\n\nWe are pumped to bring you a **big** patch only 4 days after launch! We had three primary areas of focus for this patch:\n\n:bug: **Bug Fixes**, improving stability, and improving performance\n:computer: **Quality-of-Life** and UI improvements\n:wrench: **Game Balance** for adventures, augments, and weapons\n\n:bug: **Bug Fixes**\n\nWe've worked hard on improving performance and reducing memory issues - this is a **work in progress** that we'll continue focusing on throughout all phases of the beta!\n\n+ We made a lot of progress on the **dreaded :white_large_square: white screen crash** - you should see it much less often.\n+ Improved some performance issues with lots of items in the Hub World.\n+ Fixed a bug where players could be headless.\n+ Fixed a bug where players could freeze when entering a new world.\n+ Fixed many bugs where players could sneak through terrain, including around (most) boss arenas.\n+ Fixed a bug where the Boss Wisp NPC would think you were on the wrong side of the arena.\n+ Fixed a bug where the Mirrored Dragon would be occasionally invulnerable.\n+ Fixed Mirrored Dragon's spawned Sliver minions moving through walls.\n+ Fixed a bug where augments would always show 'Glacial' as their projectile speed modifier.\n+ Fixed a few tooltip/details bugs with Weapons & Augments.\n+ Fixed a bug where Icebound Augmented weapons could produce projectiles of truly ridiculous size, that would clip terrain in awkward ways.\n\n:computer: **Quality-of-Life**\n\n+ LOOT is now sorted from highest level to lowest on most screens.\n+ Added **Search** for the Stash and other panels, searching any text will show any items that match in the name, for example: `3 piece` will show you all your 3 Piece Shoot Augments. :uncommon:\n+ Equip/Attach tooltips should better explain why you cannot Equip or Attach something (too low level, incompatible augment+weapon, etc.)\n+ Added a 'Skip Tutorial' button in Settings\n\n\n:wrench: **Game Balance**\n\nWe expect that game balance could be wildly in flux throughout closed beta, because no team can get this right without a wonderful group of players to help demonstrate and break it!\n\n**Please bear with us as we make frequent minor and major adjustments through the entirity of beta.**\n\n+ The number of Augment Slots on a Weapon now scales up with **rarity** :legendary:, meaning that higher rarity items will **more often** spawn with more slots - but not always!\n+ Changed the slot limit for different levels of weapons:\n    + Level 1: 2 slots\n    + Level 16: 3 slots\n    + Level 31: 4 slots\n    + Level 61: 5 slots\n    + Level 91: 6 slots\n\n+ Majorly buffed many augments, anywhere from 5-40% increased damage:\n    + **Cluster Shot** (less damage penalty)\n    + **Debilitator** (+flat damage, -% damage)\n    + **Icebound** (+damage)\n    + **Pierce** (less damage penalty)\n    + **Rapid Fire** (+damage)\n    + **Sniper** (+damage, +range)\n    + **Taser** (+damage)\n    + **Tighten Spread** (+damage)\n\n+ Buffed a couple Enchantments, and nerfed one:\n    + **Extra Projectiles** (less damage penalty)\n    + **Big Bad Beam** (+damage)\n    + **Overcharged Shot** (-damage) - We intend to make this only work with Charge weapons in a future patch.\n\n+ Also nerfed many augments, usually around 13-5% decreased damage, but a few were *very* out-of-line:\n    + **Slowshooty** - This augment was WILDLY powerful and has been brought down a significant amount\n    + **Creeping Death** (-damage)\n    + **Diffusion Beam/Focused Beam/Star Laser** (-damage)\n    + **Flamethrower** (-damage)\n    + **Quick Charge** - Another massive DPS increase that was brought more in-line\n    + **Stat Up+** (-damage at higher levels, same at lower levels)\n\n+ Some Augments were able to be used on weapons they weren't intended for, here are some changes to augment restrictions:\n    + **Lightning Burst** - No longer usable on Spellswords\n    + **Boomerang** - No longer usable on Crossbows\n    + **Flamethrower, Rapid Fire, Slowshooty** - No longer usable on Crossbows/Staves\n\n+ Charge-up weapons don't make significant use of Attack Rate, so augments that adjust Attack Rate shouldn't benefit them\n\n+ Changed the damage multiplier for a full charge on charge-up weapons, from 250% for **Crossbows and Staves** to 200% for Staves and 225% for Crossbows\n+ Slightly reduced the charge rate of high level (30+) **Crossbows and Staves**\n+ Capped Splash Damage at 100%\n+ Dreamers now skillfully fight back!

The **Smelting Furnace Improvements** are a key highlight, and will let you collect coins at **any** time, even if smelting hasn’t finished.

No more long waits without coins.\n*   Substantially improved Hub World server performance, especially when players in the Hub have loads of items.\n    * We do intend to add Stash Limits (upgradable) in a future patch, to keep stashes reasonable.\n*   Added a notification to both the Login and Hub World when new **Game News** is posted.\n\n:wrench: **Game Balance**\n\n*   The Mirrored Dragon arena has been adjusted to feel less cramped and support better tactics.\n*   Bosses with large arenas should behave and **aggro **more consistently.\n*   Fixed a bug where Mirrored Dragon would be a total **derp** in the corners of the arena.\n\n:bug: **Bug Fixes**\n\n*   Removed the Item Search from several screens where it was unnecessary.\n*   Performance improvements when moving items between different stations in the Hub World.\n*   You can no longer attempt to list an item on the Marketplace if you cannot afford the listing fee.\n*   The character preview in the ‘Change Skin’ screen now updates properly.\n*   The ‘Trash your inventory?’ prompt after sending a worm now shows up after each worm, as intended.\n*   You can no longer accidentally close video ads by pressing certain hotkeys.\n*   The Compass UI now properly updates when you send a worm in your furthest unlocked Outpost.\n*   Fixed a bug where ‘Critical!’ hit messages would stick around.",

		"body": "**Patch 0.8.3 - Closed Beta**\n\nWelcome to Patch 0.8.3! This week we're adding 'NEW!' badges to newly looted items, reworking a bunch of Augments, adding new Special Modifiers to add some fun gameplay to our item system, and much more!\n\n:computer: **Quality-of-Life**\n\n+ Newly looted items will display 'NEW!' for easier sorting :smile:\n+ The Inventory in the Adventure World is now sorted by rarity, and then level\n    + This should make it easier to toss low priority items\n\n:bug: **Bugs**\n\n+ Made it so that boss ground target AoE attacks will not land outside the boss arena\n+  Bosses now reset their health if their arena is empty of players! No more slowly chipping away at them :cheese:\n+ Fixed an issue where the prism boss could be stuck in a bad state if players die during the cocoon phase \n\n:wrench: **Game Balance**\n\n**Special Modifiers**\nAs teased here: [Discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/763129740890472468/831927134980800573/854498953130672139)\n\nWe're adding a new 'Special Modifiers' section on items. These modifiers aren't just stats, but can provide a wide range of benefits:\n+ Adding 'chance to proc', like 'on hit' or 'on kill' bonuses\n+ 'Unique' bonuses - could be anything!\n+ Converting stats from one kind to another\n+ Much more!\n\n**:heart: Improved Healing Hearts**\nWe wanted hearts to feel more impactful, so we doubled the healing on each heart, but reduced how many drop.\n\n---\n\n**:legendary: Augments**\n**Elemental Damage Conversion**\nEach of these Augments now convert some of your physical damage to elemental damage: **Flamethrower**, **Icebound**, **Taser**, **Debilitator**, **Lightning Burst**. More special modifiers!\n\n+ **Flamethrower Augment**: No longer has a projectile penalty, but instead converts extra projectiles to attack rate.\n+ **Icebound Augment**: No longer has a projectile penalty, but instead converts extra projectiles to bonus size and damage.\n+ **Debilitator:** Attack rate bonus reduced from x1.25~ to x1.1~\n+ Added new augment mystery mods: ?????\n\n**Augment Attack Rate Change**\nAugments have had an unintended, extremely high attack rate mod available at higher tiers (up to x2.9 or higher). This mod actually leads to server performance issues, especially if players are running 5-6 copies of mods with these attack rate boosts. While we do apply diminishing returns to attack rate above a certain point, it wasn't enough to prevent players from being able to create enough projectiles to lag out the server (and each other!)\n\nThis Attack Rate mod has been rescaled to provide up to **x1.98 attack rate**, and now has tiers available up through level 99 (previously capped at level 75).\n\nHowever, we're making Augments **much** more interesting with new and improved mods to chase! :eyes: Inspect your new Augment drops carefully!\n\n---\n\n**:magic_wand: Weapons **\n+ Slightly reduced the range and projectile speed on Arcane Focus\n+ Added new weapon mods: **crit chance** and **crit damage**\n\n**Mini Wand Rework**\nWands used to have a x0.5 projectile penalty. This was replaced with a 'Maximum of 3 proj. count' penalty, allowing wands to more easily benefit from a couple extra projectiles. (btw, this is a special modifier!)\n\nPew pew!\n\n---\n\n**:gearpendant: Gear  **\n+ **Overshield**: Max shields reduced from 4 to 3; duration reduced by 20%~; multiple uses of Overshield now only recover 3 missing shields, not ALL shields.\n\n**New Gear Mods**\nWe added several 'Special Modifiers' for gear that provide some unique bonuses. Find them!\n\n**Misc.**\n+ Rebalanced the level that certain mods start appearing on weapons, augments, and gear\n    + Movement speed\n    + Max shields\n    + Splash radius/damage\n    + Pierce\n",
