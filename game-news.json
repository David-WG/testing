		"body": "**Welcome to LOOT.io Closed Beta!**\n\nWe are so excited to be able to share our game with you! We wanted to quickly showcase what to expect during the Closed Beta.\n\n+ **Explore** a mysterious world.\n+ Defeat monstrous enemies.\n+ Collect **rare loot**!\n+ Visit an **Outpost** to send your loot back to town.\n+ Die and repeat!\n\nHead back to town and equip weapons, augments, and gear to **completely** customize your playstyle. If you're happy with what you have equipped, then put newfound loot in the **Smelting Furnaces** to earn coins or list your best items on the **Marketplace** to sell to other players.\n\nThe game you are about to play is **not the final version**, but a solid representation of what the game will be, and what we are aiming for. We are still actively developing to craft the best experience for players, and we will act swiftly to resolve issues and improve the game based on feedback.\n\nPlease **share your thoughts** on [Discord](https://discord.gg/jffWpwAvfs). We would love to hear your thoughts, opinions, concerns, and compliments!\n\nThanks again for signing up and happy looting!\n\nTips\n\n+ For the best experience, please use a mouse for shooting and aiming. It's much easier than a touchpad.\n+ In the Adventure World, use the **Compass** (top right corner) to quickly find locations in-game.\n+ In the Hub World (town), use the **Main Menu** (top right corner) to quickly access different vendors and stations to save yourself the walk.\n+ The tutorial in the Hub World only directs you to 3 locations, but feel free to explore everything!\n+ Want to change your character's look? Open the **Player Profile** from the main menu and select 'Change Skin'. Many different looks to choose from!\n+ Though the game will work on all browsers, we recommend Chrome if you have a choice.\n\nKnown Issues\n\n+ When a run is ended voluntarily, the death animation will play. This is strictly visual and does not impact any loot returning. \n+ Occasionally the game will display a white screen, due to a WebGL or 'Out of memory' crash. You can refresh the page to bypass this issue.\n+ There may be delays between input and in game actions, most notable during times of high player/enemy count during combat.\n+ Compass' 'POI' option will only point to one POI location in biomes that have 2.\n+ Weapon PFX (such as a charge up or a beam) can be offset from the weapon when moving around.\n+ Slight delay when posting or purchasing an item from the Marketplace, along with collecting coins from the Furnace.\n+ Rarity filter on the Augment screen can be changed during the tutorial causing a soft block.  If this happens, just clear the filter to be able to perform the appropriate action.\n",
